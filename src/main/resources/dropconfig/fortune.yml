  example:
    # in chances, you write numbers and simply that numbers is addition to base drop chance
    chances:
      - 10.0 # on Fortune I
      - 20.0 # on Fortune II
      - 50.0 # on Fortune III
      # you can add additions as you want, it isn't limited to third level, but if you'll use better level than max of here, there won't be any addition to chance
    additional-drops: # in this section, you write additional drop amount. So if in example default amount of drop is 1-6, and e.g. you without fortune drop 3 diamonds, then with fortune 2 you'll drop additional from one to two diamonds.
      # Scheme is 'min : max'
      - '0 : 1' # on Fortune I
      - '1 : 2' # on Fortu...
      - '1 : 3'
      # same rule like on chances
